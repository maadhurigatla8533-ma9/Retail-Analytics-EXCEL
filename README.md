## LES Retail - Sales Performance Dashboard

I’m excited to share a project where I built a comprehensive sales performance dashboard for LES Retail.

While data analysis often starts with numbers, it’s not just about data — it’s about understanding the business behind the data. This project taught me how to connect trends with real-world decisions, like which products to promote, where to allocate inventory, and which customers to prioritize.

Uncovered the top 10 customers by transaction value — critical for loyalty strategy and client segmentation.

### 🛒 Product Performance Over Time
Spotted top-selling products during a specific sales window, offering insight for demand forecasting.

### 🏙 City & State-Level Performance
Cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore emerged as sales hotspots, showing where to double down.

### 🗂 Category Performance by City
Each city showed unique preferences — essential knowledge for localized marketing and supply chain planning.
